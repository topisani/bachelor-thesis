This thesis explores using an embedded domain specific language to write audio signal processing programs
modelled as block diagrams. Building on existing research on an algebra to describe block diagrams, it
provides the basis of a C++ library that implements such an EDSL. It goes on to explore real-world usage of
said library by implementing an audio plugin, as well as expanding the library with support for multirate DSP
algorithms. Using these techniques, the characteristics and advantages of an EDSL are shown.
