 - Introduction
  - Structure:
    - Domain: Audio Processing
      - continous analogue signal to discrete digital frames
      - (VST, LV2, plugins), embedded systems such as digital guitar effects, 
      - fixed signal path / constant time algorithms
      - reactive programming comparison
       - rxpy
     - continuous, fixed rate signals
    - Constraints / Problem
      - programmers in the domain are often not programmers primarilly
